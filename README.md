## Introduction 
Men are three times more likely to die from suicide than women in the UK. As the pandemic continues, the economy will suffer. According to the BBC, 18-24 months after every economic downturn, the rates of suicide skyrocket. Although we haven't felt the surge, it will come. We need to be prepared.

## The Team
Nazar Yaremko - Ukraine
Pablo Guarneros - Mexico 

## Likely extensions:
- Rather than sending the user to complete their 8-step-plan outside, giving them the ability to generate it and keeps tabs within the platform
- Because most conversations about mental health between men follow the "shoulder-to-shoulder principle," we would host livestreams of sport events that our users can watch through the app. Shoulder to shoulder principle: having a conversation about sensitive topics while occupied in other things.

## Potential Dangers:
- We still have to optimize for accessibility
    - 1)  For people that do not have access to a computer, the app is not yet mobile friendly. Without fixing this, we risk not giving help to a big subset of the population.
    - 2) We must rename objects and elements, so people with visual impairment can use the platform too.
