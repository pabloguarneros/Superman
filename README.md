## The Current Problem

 A) Men are three times more likely to die from suicide than women, but men rarely get help. Traditional gender roles play a role in why men are less likely to seek help for their mental health problems. Some men say they are too embarrassed to talk about mental health and don't want to appear weak. But if they can't talk about it, what do they do? 

 B) Although there are apps men can download, only 7% of mental health apps incorporate all six necessary suicide prevention strategies. For Martinengo et.al.(2019), this is a failure of the current digital market.
  
## Our Solution 
To address this problem, we built Supermän, a resource to help men a) better understand why they are more likely to struggle with mental health and b) provide them with the necessary tools missing in the current digital market: tracking of mood and suicidal thoughts, safety plan development, offering activities to deter suicidal thoughts, access to support networks, and quick emergency counseling). We hope Supermän can turn into the launching pad that equips men to proactively improve their mental health by integrating these tools.

## Looking Ahead
1. Improve accessibility of the application by a) making the portal mobile-friendly for people without access to a computer, b) increasing the website's readability for people with visual impairments, and c) translating the website in Ukrainian, Spanish, and Hindi.
2. Rather than having people print out and fill in their Safety Plan, we will make it easy for them to do on the platform.
3. Meet with additional mental health professionals and beta-test the product with more users to improve the tools.
4. We look forward to tying the mood tracker with the NLP algorithm to better track which days or months the user's moods fluctuate. Using this information, we can personalize the resources on the dashboard (e.g., videos and activities).
